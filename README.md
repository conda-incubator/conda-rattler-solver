# conda-rattler-solver

The fast pixi solver, now in conda!

## What is this exactly?

If `conda-libmamba-solver` brought the `mamba` solver to `conda`, `conda-rattler-solver` tries to integrate the `pixi` solver (called `rattler`) in `conda`.

This is an experiment to see how easy it would be to integrate new solves in `conda` after the initial work done in `conda-libmamba-solver`.

Not meant for production use.
